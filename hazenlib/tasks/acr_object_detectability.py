`ACR Large Phantom Guidance PDF <https://accreditationsupport.acr.org/helpdesk/attachments/11093487417>`_

Intro
_____

Performs a series of Image Processing steps that attempts to

    #. Isolate the signal of the spots inside the circle ROI in slices 8 through 11.
    #. Predict where spots should be present in ROI.
    #. Walk through the predicted spot ROIs.
    #. Asses if spoke is valid.
    #. Stop at first invalid spoke.
    #. Calculate the slice score.

A lot of the tuning performed attempts to strike a balance between the real number of high intensity signals and
avoiding overestimation. As a result, my current attempt is biased towards underestimation if the signal is too
small to survive thresholding.

ACR Algorithm
+++++++++++++

    #. Display slice 11, which has the highest contrast objects. Adjust the display window width and level
        settings for best visibility of the low contrast objects. This will usually require a fairly narrow window
        width and careful adjustment of the level to best distinguish the objects from the background.
    #. Count the number of complete spokes. Begin counting with the spoke having the largest diameter
        disks; this spoke is at 12 o’clock or slightly to the right of 12 o’clock, and is referred to as spoke 1.
        Count clockwise from spoke 1 until a spoke is reached where one or more of the disks is not
        discernible from the background. A spoke is complete only if all three disks are discernible. Count
        complete spokes, not individual disks.
    #. The score for this slice is the number of complete spokes. Record the score.
    #. Repeat the procedure to determine the number of visible spokes for the remaining LCD images.

ACR Scoring Rubric
++++++++++++++++++

For each series, record the number of complete spokes visible on each slice, then sum the values for all four
slices to determine the total LCD score. For example, if the ACR T2 series scored 3 spokes in slice 8, 5 spokes
in slice 9, 9 spokes in slice 10, and 10 spokes in slice 11; the total score for the ACR T2 series would be 3 + 5
+ 9 + 10 = 27.

Notes
_____

The approach taken here was to do a Difference of Gaussians with several blurring and thresholding steps such that
the resulting image has most of the noise dropped. Then, we dilate whatever signal is present and hope that the predicted
mask sees the signal. This approach is very error prone with very noisy scans. As a result, we threshold such that we
only consider a very high percentile threshold point based on the available signal. Furthermore, the DoG operation tends
to introduce a rim of noise on the periphery which often blends with the outer ring of spots. Per my tuning, this is
minimized, but still exists. To avoid this artifact, I can decrease the aggressiveness of the DoG operation at the cost
of more residual noise in the final output. The reason I tried this approach first is that I was interested in
avoiding adding more dependencies and training a neural network for this task at this moment. However, current testing
suggests that I should read about blob detection algorithms and consider machine learning as well. It could be a very
productive approach long term.

The Hough Transform does not work reliably for this task. You really are looking into blob detection more so than circle
detection. DoG returns a decently cleaned image for further analysis. The result is just not easy to clean via
thresholding.

TL;DR; I definitely need to return to this task and try a cleaner approach using blob detection.

        Notes
        _____

        ..note::

            The weird Gaussian filtering passes not associated with the DoG have subtle and profound effects on what
            signal survives all of our filtering levers.

        ..note::

            The DoG implementation used here also allows for the application of gamma correction and multiple passes.
            However, none of these options ended up being necessary on the final version of this algorithm. I made
            the implementations available as individual methods in the ACRObject class for other future image
            manipulation tasks.

        ..warning::

            The scoring algorithm is a very dumb algorithm in that it computes the center of a spot ROI and performs
            a sum on the captured pixel population. Any values > 0 are assumed to imply that the neighborhood signal
            must have come from a strong signal. However, this is only an approximation to reality and thus it is
            weak against inputs that are noisy after all of our filtering steps. As a result, it is strongly encouraged
            to provide a copy of the dilated output in the report to allow for visual inspection of the noise
            distribution. I am not clever enough to figure out how to detect this kind of noise after generating
            results.

        ..alert::

            The GE dataset present in this repository is particularly troublesome because it represents a case in which
            there is a poor SNR on a high resolution (0.5mm) 512x512 FoV. This is a problem because the ACR prescribed
            that the matrix has to be 256x256 with a resolution of 1.0mm. The main issue is if I make the algorithm
            robust to the ACR Phantom requirements, the algorithm becomes weak to the GE data's 8th slice, which is
            pure noise. The algorithm somehow detects the alignment of the noise spots and yields at least 2 valid
            spokes when that should not be the case.
