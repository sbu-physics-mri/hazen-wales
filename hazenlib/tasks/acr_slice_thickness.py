Intro
_____

The slice thickness accuracy test assesses the accuracy with which a slice of specified thickness is achieved.
The prescribed slice thickness is compared with the measured slice thickness.

The ramps appear in a structure called the slice thickness insert. Figure 10 shows an image of slice 1 with
the slice thickness insert and signal ramps identified. The two ramps are crossed: one has a negative slope
and the other a positive slope with respect to the plane of slice 1. They are produced by cutting 1 mm wide
slots in a block of plastic. The slots are open to the interior of the phantom and are filled with the same
solution that fills the bulk of the phantom.

The signal ramps have a slope of 10 to 1 with respect to the plane of slice 1, which is an angle of about 5.71°.
Therefore, the signal ramps will appear in the image of slice 1 with a length that is 10 times the thickness of
the slice. If the phantom is misaligned from right-left, one ramp will appear longer than the other. The
crossed ramps allow for correction of the error introduced by right-left misalignment, and the slice thickness
formula takes that into account.

ACR Guidelines
______________

ACR Algorithm
+++++++++++++

    #. Display slice 1, and magnify the image by a factor of 2 to 4, keeping the slice thickness insert fully
        visible on the screen.
    #. Adjust the display level so that the signal ramps are well visualized.
        *. The ramp signal is much lower than that of surrounding water, so usually it will be necessary
            to lower the display level substantially and narrow the window.
    #. Place a rectangular ROI at the middle of each ramp as shown below in Figure 11.
        *. Note the mean signal values for each of these two ROIs and then average those values.
        *. The result is a number approximating the mean signal in the middle of the ramps.
        *. An elliptical ROI may be used if a rectangular one is unavailable.
    #. Lower the display level to half of the average ramp signal calculated in step 3.
        *. Leave the display window set to its minimum.
    #. Use the on-screen distance measurement tool to measure the lengths of the top and bottom ramps.
        This is illustrated below in Figure 12. Record these lengths and compare to the action limits.

Our Approximation
+++++++++++++++++

    #. Find the phantom center.
    #. Zoom input x4.
    #. Crop insert around initial center.
    #. Apply Window Width and Window Level based on cropped region.
    #. Identify the Y coordinates by sampling a line profile at the sample crop center and finding highest 2 peaks.
    #. Identify the X coordinates by sampling line profiles in the horizontal direction going through the Y points.
    #. Place rectangular ROIs at those centers with a fixed width.
    #. Apply WL based on ROI averages.
    #. Identify widths.
    #. Use ACR formula for results.

ACR Scoring Rubric
++++++++++++++++++

The slice thickness is calculated using the following formula:

    Slice thickness = 0.2 x (top x bottom)/(top + bottom)

In the formula above, the `top` and `bottom` are the measured lengths of the top and bottom signal ramps.

**Note:** 0.2 is a unitless factor that corrects for rotation of the phantom about the vertical (y) axis.

For example, if the top signal ramp were 59.5mm long and the bottom ramp were 47.2mm long, then the
calculated slice thickness would be:

    Slice thickness = 0.2 x (59.5mm x 47.2mm)/(59.5mm + 47.2mm) = 5.26 mm.


Notes
_____

..note::

    A failure of this test means that the scanner is producing slices of substantially different thickness from the
    prescribed thickness. This problem will generally not occur in isolation since the scanner deficiencies that
    can cause it may also cause other image problems. Therefore, the implications of a failure are not just that
    the slices are too thick or thin, but can also result in poor image contrast and low SNR.

..warning::

    When making these measurements, **be careful to fully cover the widths of the ramp with the
    ROIs** in the top-bottom direction, but not to allow the ROIs to stray outside the ramps into adjacent
    high- or low-signal regions. If there is a large difference,(that is, more than 20%), between the signal
    values obtained for the ROIs, it is often due to one or both of the ROIs including regions outside the
    ramps.
